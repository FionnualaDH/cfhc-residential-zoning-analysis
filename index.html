        Welcome to the Connecticut Zoning Initiative</a>, a website with
        data on residential land-use regulations for municipalities
        across the state. This page includes a scrollable “card view”
        listing data for each town, a link to a full spreadsheet
        with data for all towns in Connecticut, a link to the
        definitions used for this project, a place to provide comments,
        and several maps illustrating the potential power of the data.
      </p>

      <p>
        The goal of this collaborative effort between the Connecticut
        Fair Housing Center and the Cities Suburbs & Schools Project at
        Trinity College is to promote smart, fair and effective
        land-use policy by collecting and presenting accurate town-by-town
        zoning data. Information is current as of May 2013,
        unless otherwise stated, and based on definitions as described below.
      </p>

        <h2 class="f2">Map 1: Multifamily Housing Permitted</h2>

        <p>
          The map shows whether a town's zoning regulations allow multifamily housing
          of three or more units, and if so, whether the zoning regulations require a
          special permit or if they allow multifamily housing by right.

      <p>
        The map shows the percentage of housing stock in each town meeting Connecticut's
        statutory definition of affordable housing, according to General Statute 8-30g,
        which includes government assisted units, tenant rental assistance,
        CHFA/USDA mortgages, and deed restricted units.
